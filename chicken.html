    <h3>Steps for Making Tandoori Chicken</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove and discard skin from chicken pieces. Cut slits into meat and place into<br>a shallow dish. Season chicken on both sides with lemon juice and salt. Let sit <br>for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix yogurt, onion, garlic, garam masala, ginger, and cayenne pepper together in<br>a medium bowl until smooth, then stir in food coloring.</li>
        <li>Spread yogurt mixture over chicken, cover, and refrigerate for 6 to 24 hours (the<br>longer the better).</li>
        <li>When ready to cook, preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly<br>oil the grate. Remove chicken from marinade. Discard remaining marinade.</li>
        <li>Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink and the juices run clear.<br>An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F</li>
        <li>Garnish with cilantro and lemon wedges.</li>
    </ol>
